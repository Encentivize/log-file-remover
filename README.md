# winston-log-remover
A tool to automate removal of logs generated by winston (npm package) after a set amount of time.

##Install
  npm install winston-log-remover

##Usage
  - require the library in your code
  - entry point is index.js

  ```javascript
  var winstonLogRemover = require('winston-log-remover');
  winstonLogRemover.schedule(config);
  ```

##Config JSON Object
The library will accept a custom config object being passed into the schedule function. If no object is passed through then the default config will be used.

##Default object passed into the scheduler unless otherwise specified.
```json
{
    "timeZone": "Africa/Johannesburg", 
    "logging": {
        "file": {
            "folder": "/logs",
            "retention": {
                "units": "days",
                "amount": 7
            },
            "timeToTake": "mtime"
        },
        "startTheJobAutomatically": false,
        "cronTime": "* * * * *"
    }
}
```

If startTheJobAutomatically is set to false, remember to call job.start(), assuming job is the variable you set the cron job to.

For the timeZone if you need others, check the moment-timezone npm module

timeToTake is the time which will be looked at when deleting logs.	
timeToTake is either mtime, ctime or fileName. The modified time, the created time or a date specified in the file name.
The filename looked at follows this expression: `log-file-name.2016-01-13T14`
