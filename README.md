# winston-log-remover
A tool to automate removal of logs generated by winston (npm package) after a set amount of time.

##Install
  npm install winston-log-remover
##Usage
  - require the library in your code
  - entry point is index.js
  `var winstonLogRemover = require('winston-log-remover');`
###To Configure:
  `winstonLogRemover.configure();`
###To Use:
  `winstonLogRemover.schedule(config);`
  You can also implicity pass through configuration to the schedule function if saving a configuration json is not ideal.

##Config JSON Object
 ###Default object passed into the scheduler unless otherwise specified.
 ```json
	{
	    "timeZone": "Africa/Johannesburg", // if you need others, check the moment-timezone npm module
	    "logging": {
	        "file": {
	            "folder": "/logs",
	            "retention": {
	                "units": "days",
	                "amount": 7
	            },
	            "timeToTake": "mtime"
	        },
	        "startTheJobAutomatically": false,
	        "cronTime": "* * * * *"
	    }
	}
 ```
 If startTheJobAutomatically is set to false, remember to call job.start(), assuming job is the variable you set the cron job to.

###timeToTake
This is the time which will be looked at when deleting logs.	
timeToTake is either mtime, ctime or fileName. The modified time, the created time or a date specified in the file name.
The filename looked at follows this expression: `log-file-name.2016-01-13T14`
